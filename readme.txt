There are two of my homework solutions in this directory. hw2 is to generate a tree from data. hw3 is to manipulate different charts interactively. JavaScript and D3 are used in both homework assignments. 

In each folder, there is readme.txt that describes what you can see/manipulate on the html page. If you cannot open the page, please let me know or follow the instructions given in readme.md.
